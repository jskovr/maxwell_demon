computationally: ok to have an ideal gas, use 50 particles instead of 10^23 particles, tweak the ideal gas law

less literature publications (e.g. superfluid He^3), won't find publications on the leonard jones potential anymore


real non ideal gases have multiple proponents
one leonard jones reaction for A and A interact
different for B and B to interact
third for A and B to interact
